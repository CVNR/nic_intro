# Neuroimaging Core Introduction

Welcome to the Neuroimaging Core (NIC) GitHub page! In this repository you will find information on introductory documents, guides, and protocols relating to neuroimaging acquisition, analysis, and interpretation conducted at the Center for Visual and Neuorocognitive Rehabilitation (CVNR). Additionally, we have included our infrastructure setup and policies that are maintained by the NIC. It is our hope that these repositories will assist you and your team in conducting neuroimaging research.
