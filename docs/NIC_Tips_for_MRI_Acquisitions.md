## **Background Information**

This document is for PIs and researchers collecting MRI data with the intention of assisting in data acquisition experience. Researchers should remember that for many
participants, this is their first time being a part of an MRI study so they may be quite nervous. Such nerves can result in the participant moving alot in the scanner 
which, in turn, will result in motion artifacts that can make the data collected unusable. Therefore, it is a good idea to make sure that participant is as comfortable
as possible before entering into the scanner. What follows are tips to aid you in such an endeavour.


## **Scheduling**

If you feel rushed when setting up MRI equipment before the participant enters the scanner room, we recommend requesting earlier scan time. Give yourself at least 15 
extra mintues (depending on your study's protocol) to set up equipment and prep software on the computers. You can e-mail the MRI technicians at Emory to work out
scheduling.


## **Prep Time**

If possible, try to set up your study specific equipment and devices before the patient enters into the scanner room If you don not already, we recommend bringing a
printed out copy of your study's protocol to aid you in setting up. This can aid as a check-list and reduce your own stress of trying to remember what goes where and how.
Importantly, during this prep time, we highly recommend that you take some time to center yourself to reduce your own stress. This can take many forms such as breathing
excercises or rehearsing what you intend to say to the patient before they enter the scanner. Whatever works best for you. This is important because your relaxed state 
will ease the participant's own stress before the task, thus reducing the likelihood of movement in the scanner.


## **Before Entering the Scanner**

When giving the instructions to participant try to speak calmly and slowly to (1) reduce the patient's stress and (2) to ensure that the participant fully understands
what they are suppsoe to do in the scanner (task vs resting-state). Frequently, ask they participant if they understood your instructions and if they have any questions 
or concerns.

## **Getting in the Scanner**

When getting the participant in the scanner it is crucial that they feel comfortable to reduce fidgeting, shifting and general bodily movement during data collection. Be
patient and reassuring with the participant and ask if they are in any pain or feeling any discomfort.

Following these tips will result in a smoother data acquisition experience for the participant, yourself and you will see a reduction inthe amount of data lost due to
participant movement.
